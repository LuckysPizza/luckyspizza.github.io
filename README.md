# i've moved my shit
Because of [Microsoft acquiring Github this year](https://archive.is/ZVzmz), I have decided to move my website to [Neocities](https://lucke.neocities.org) and to start posting my code on [GitGud](https://gitgud.io/lucke).

As for you, Microsoft, I have a message for you as well: https://a.doko.moe/abodce.mp3
