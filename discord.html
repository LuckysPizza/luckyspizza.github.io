    <h3>What is this place?</h3>
    <p>
      The Jihad Cafe is a continuous scientific experiment placed in a Discord server made to test and power the theory that if enough <a href="https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/You">gay autists</a> stay in one place forever, they will thus allow the rest of <a href="https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/humanity">Humanity</a> to live and prosper. We are the most autistic beings known to man.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What are the rules?</h3>
    <p>
      There are no rules. You are entirely free to <a href="https://e621.net">violate our eyes</a>, <a href="https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Spam"</a>ruin the entire server for everyone</a>, and even break <a href="https://discordapp.com/terms#rules-of-conduct-and-usage">Discord's horrific and restrictive rules of conduct and usage</a>, the last of which you are much encouraged to do. <strong><a href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">Keep in mind, however, that I and the moderators of the Jihad Cafe reserve the right to kick, ban, mute, deafen, and in any other way restrict you in the server however we fucking please, and likely do not give a shit about how you might respond to that.</a></strong>
												       </p>
<h3>What is the server like?</h3>
<p>
  It's as minimalistic as my effort in life and as plain as my shit. There is only one channel that normal members can send messages to, a channel called <strong>#the-archive</strong> that only members with the <font color="#b4c71b">wireshark user</font> role can type in, and two more channels, a welcome screen and announcement section.
</p>
<h3>Where do I join?</h3>
<p>
  You've made a poor decision, but I'm no one to judge. <a href="https://discord.gg/8zj8Ywk">Here</a>.
