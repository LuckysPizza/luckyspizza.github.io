	<h3>What the fuck is this?</h3>
	<p>The Jihad Cafe is an ongoing experiment created to determine how long it takes for autism in humans to become deadly. This experiment is conducted within a Discord group of the same name, and you may join it to contribute to science, and your ever-so-lacking mental capacity.</p>
	<h3>Why should I join?</h3>
	<p>That's simple! We have all of the cool kid stuff, including:</p>

	<p>There are none, fuckwit! None except these, anyway:</p>
